Game prepared for GamJam UCSC Alumni 2022 where it was decided to make a 3D platform game using the Ultimate Platformer Pack found at this link.

This game aims to learn how to use Godot 3.5.1 resources to build some systems:
1. Learn to create more realistic river systems
2. Devise a system for moving the enemy in random ways.
3. Gain experience in scenario building
